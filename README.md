# Yet Another Vim Railscasts Colorscheme

Another slightly tweaked interpretation of the [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/about) color theme, originally for TextMate.
I make no claim of authenticity, just personal preference.

Originally based on [Nick Moffitt's version](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175) which itself was based on someone else's.

Things still look a little weird with `termguicolors` turned on.
Fixing that is my current goal.
