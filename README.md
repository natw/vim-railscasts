# Yet Another Vim Railscasts Colorscheme

Another slightly tweaked interpretation of the [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/about) color theme, originally for TextMate.
I make no claim of authenticity, just personal preference.

Originally based on [Nick Moffitt's version](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175) which itself was based on someone else's.

I use neovim these days, but I try to keep this at least compatible with regular vim.
No promises that things will look as good, but it shouldn't blow up on you.

I have finally gone through and removed all the terminal colors, so if you need those, tough.
